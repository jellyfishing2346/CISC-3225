## Project Overview
This final project requires you to conduct an in-depth analysis of a dataset using techniques learned in class. You will explore the data, perform high-level analyses, and compile your findings into a professional report.

## Dataset Recommendation
Instead of the datasets suggested in the instructions, we recommend using the **Spotify Tracks Genre Dataset** available on Kaggle:  
[Spotify Tracks Genre Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/spotify-tracks-genre-dataset)  

This dataset contains a large number of rows and includes:
- **Continuous variables**: Danceability, energy, loudness, tempo, duration, etc.
- **Categorical variables**: Genre, key, mode, time signature, etc.  

It is ideal for exploring trends in music preferences and audio features across genres.

## Project Requirements

### 1. Exploratory Analysis
- Identify and handle missing values (if any).
- For numeric variables:
  - Calculate mean, min, max, and median.
  - Compute correlations between continuous variables.
  - Visualize distributions (e.g., histograms, box plots) and note outliers.
- For categorical variables:
  - Show value counts and visualize with bar charts.

### 2. High-Level Analysis
Perform at least **6** higher-level analyses, such as:
- Using Pandas to answer specific questions (e.g., "Which genre has the highest average danceability?").
- Cluster analysis to group tracks by audio features.
- Machine learning task (e.g., genre classification or regression on track popularity).
- Linear regression to explore relationships (e.g., between loudness and energy).
- Include statistical tests and visualizations where applicable.

### 3. Final Report Structure
1. **Introduction**: Describe the dataset, its purpose, and your analysis goals.
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Summarize key observations with supporting visualizations.
3. **High-Level Analysis**: Present each analysis in its own section with visualizations.
4. **Conclusions**: Discuss insights, limitations, and potential future work.

## Submission Guidelines
- **Deadline**: May 15, 2025, at 11:59 PM (late submissions not accepted).
- **Files to Submit**:
  - Written report (PDF, Word, or similar).
  - Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) with executable code.
- **Check-ins**: Attend three check-ins for feedback (10 points each).

---

## Additional Notes
- Use domain knowledge or research to explain findings (cite sources if needed).
- Code should be included only if necessary for clarity; focus on results in the report.
- For questions, attend office hours or check Blackboard for updates.  

Good luck, and have fun analyzing the Spotify dataset! ðŸŽµ
